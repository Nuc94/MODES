# MODES
Modelica package for the implementation of parallel DEVS systems for DES systems modelling and simulation

## Description

MODES (MOdelica Discrete Event Systems) is a Modelica library designed to run discrete events simulations in OpenModelica environment. It is composed by the following subpackages:

* Atomic_PKG: package containing the Atomic block from which to start creating DEVS atomic models.
* Template_PKG: providing a starting point to extend the Atomic partial block from Atomic_PKG.
* EventsLib: a library to perform discrete event simulations with blocks based on the parallel DEVS formalism.

Additionally, in this distribution the following packages can be found:

* I40Lab: package containing blocks to simulate the plant installed in I4.0 Lab, an activity present in the thesis work describing this library.
* ServerExample_PKG: a package in which a basic Server block is defined, used as an example in the thesis work describing this library, at chapter 3.1.3.
